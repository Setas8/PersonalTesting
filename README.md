# Personal Programming Experiments

This repository contains a collection of personal programming experiments, tools, and projects. It serves as a sandbox for testing new frameworks, libraries, and ideas, as well as developing minimal viable products (MVPs) for software applications and services.

## Contents

- **Personal Experiments:** Scripts and small projects created for learning and experimenting with different programming concepts and tools.
- **Tool Tests:** Programs built to test libraries, frameworks, or APIs for personal use and evaluation.
- **MVPs:** Minimal viable products developed for companies, clients, or personal projects to demonstrate functionality and feasibility.

## Technologies Used

This repository features projects using multiple programming languages, including but not limited to:

- Python
- JavaScript
- Java
- C++
- Go
- Html

â€¦and others depending on the project requirements.

## Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to:

- Explore new programming techniques and tools.
- Build small projects to evaluate frameworks or APIs.
- Create MVPs for applications or business ideas.
- Share learning and progress with the programming community.

## Contributing

These are mainly personal projects, but contributions are welcome if you want to collaborate on improving any of the experiments or MVPs. Please open an issue or a pull request with your suggestions.

## License

All projects are open for personal experimentation and learning. Check individual project folders for specific licenses if applicable.
